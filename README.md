# pipeline-server
The IData Pipeline is an open-source no-code AWS data pipeline. No coding required, just configure, ingest and consume. Using a simple JSON configuration for each dataset, you can inform the Pipeline what tasks should be performed upon a dataset. 

The Pipeline can perform deduplication of data, data quality checks, transformation with Javascript, transformation into S3 parquet in your data lake, transformation into Redshift or Snowflake and much more. When data lands in its final destination, automatic notifications are fired via SNS, enabling downstream systems and users to be notified immediately.
